Artist Bio 
  
LISA RAQUEL COWAN
  
Lisa is a creative dance artist who thrives on creating positive
impacts, fostering connections and uniting people through the transformative power of movement. She is a Professional Dancer, Choreographer, Mother and High School Performing Arts teacher who started LRCdance with the focus on building a culture of movement and wellbeing on the Sunshine Coast and Hinterland. Lisa's dance classes, workshops and events are more than just physical activity; they are platforms for individuals to connect, express themselves, and inspire a deeper sense of unity and wellbeing.
Lisa’s great passion for community projects has given her opportunities to present workshops, curate and produce events, film and edit dance works, run short courses and create dynamic and energetic FLASHMOB spectacles at various locations on the Sunshine Coast and Hinterland, extending her passion beyond the conventional boundaries of dance and bringing much joy to the heart and lives of all involved.
Lisa completed a Bachelor of Contemporary Arts at Deakin University in 2005 (dance major) and was involved in the Melbourne arts scene choreographing and performing with Abell Legs Productions and Mayhem Cabaret for various Fringe Festivals.
During her degree she travelled to Ghana where she studied, taught and performed with the Asanti Dance Theatre, immersing herself into the culture. The African dance influence is still strong in Lisa’s style today.
Lisa later completed her Post Graduate Degree in Education and has worked for Education QLD as a Senior Dance Teacher between her creative projects.
In 2012 Lisa moved to Nicaragua, Central America and for 5 years Lisa dedicated her time passing on her skills and passion for the art form by teaching, creating and directing large-scale productions with the local communities as well as teaching regular dance classes and managing Dance Camps at the Rancho Santana International School.
An avid Tai Chi student and practitioner, Lisa has recently completed her Qigong Teacher Training and has combined this modality with contemporary dance to offer short courses in holistic and dynamic movement experiences.
Lisa strongly believes that dance is a universal language capable of transcending boundaries and fostering a harmonious sense of togetherness. Her aim is to continue to weave the threads of movement, wellness and community and to keep creating and collaborating locally and across the globe.
